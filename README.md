# Supermarket-Dashboard
I decided to showcase a different skill this time around: my ability to create dashboards on Excel. So here I have a dataset with 3 different branches of supermarkets from what I believe is Myanmar based on the city names. The dataset contains information such as sales, customer type, gross income, and more. I decided it would be the best data set to showcase my ability to create a dashboard in Excel with the ample amount of information I could use.
